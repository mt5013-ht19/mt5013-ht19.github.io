## Do this before class

Solve chapters *Web scraping with XPATHs* and *CSS Web Scraping and Final Case Study* at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/enterprise/statistical-data-processing-mt5013/). Read the [selectorgadget vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html).

## During class

IMPORTANT: The lack of an open API on a web site may indicate that the host is reluctant to share data. Respect this by not republishing their data without consent, see [katalogskyddet](https://lagen.nu/1960:729#P49S1) for the Swedish legal rights.

Note that there is also a R package [`robotstxt`](), which uses an informal standard for specifying up to what degree scraping etc. is allowed on a website. Check the pkg [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robotstxt/vignettes/using_robotstxt.html) for further information.
