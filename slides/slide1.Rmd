# A course in Data Science


## Not including...

- ...machine learning...

- ...Big Data architectures...

- ...formal statistical inference...

Statistics courses often focus on the **Model**-step, this course aims to focus on the other.

# Reproducibility

## Copy, Paste, Click

* As a statistician/actuary/mathematician you will be writing lots of reports.
* It is tempting to create tables and figures by copy, paste, click in and between Excel sheets.
* Exemple: Give me a figure of montly consumer price index 2017 <br>
<https://www.google.se/search?q=kpi+scb>


## Problems


* "Intresting decline at the end, but what month is 13?"
* "Nice, but I'd rather have a table?"
* Next year a colleague (or yourself) asks how you did it.


## Reproducible data analysis

> **Reproducibility**  *is the ability to get the same research results or inferences, based on the raw data and computer programs provided by researchers. * 

Cf being able to reproduce the result in an independent experiment (replicability).

## Reproducible data analysis

* Everything written in code (no copy-paste of values/tables/figures)

* Portable (the code should execute, not only on your computer today)

* Accessible (available openly)

* Fully automated from raw-data to report

# Tools for reproducible data analysis

## Code: R or Python?
```{r, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("RvsPython.png")
```

## Code: R ~~or Python~~!
```{r, out.width = "500px"}
knitr::include_graphics("RvsPython.png")
```


## R: Too many ways to do the same thing...


```
summary(mtcars$mpg)
summary(mtcars$"mpg")
summary(mtcars[, "mpg"])
summary(mtcars["mpg"])
summary(mtcars[["mpg"]])
summary(mtcars[1])
summary(mtcars[, 1])
summary(mtcars[[1]])
with(mtcars, summary(mpg))
attach(mtcars); summary(mpg)
summary(subset(mtcars, select=mpg))
```

## Code: ~~Hadleyverse~~ Tidyverse

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Hadley.jpg")
```


```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Tidyverse.png")
```

</div>
A suite of R-packages heavily influenced by Hadley Wickham at RStudio. Focus in this course.

## Automatic report generation

We need to be able to automatically kombine text, results, tables and figures.


```{r, out.width = "630px"}
knitr::include_graphics("pandoc1.png")
```

## Automatic report generation: Markdown


```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Markdown-mark.svg.png")
```

A markup language for typesetting web-pages.

<http://writeme.mattstow.com/>

## Automatic report generation: R Markdown
```{r, out.width = "200px"}
knitr::include_graphics("rmarkdown.png")
```

Adds executable code to Markdown.

## knitr: .Rmd &#8594; .md

```{r, out.width = "1000px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Rmd2md.png")
```


## Accessibility (and version control): GitHub and Git

<div class="columns-2">

```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Git-Logo-2Color.png")
```


```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("Octocat.png")
```

</div>


A software for version control and a  web-based hosting service.

## Accessibility: GitHub

* A hosting service for collaborative file sharing, mainly code
* Based on Git for version control
* <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr>


## Version control

<div class="columns-2">
<small> Bild från <http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531> </small>

```{r, out.width = "300px"}
knitr::include_graphics("phd101212s.gif")
```

Not strictly necessary for reproducibility, but important for large projects involving multiple coders. In this course it is mainly a side effect of using GitHub for publication, more about version control in *Computer Science for Mathematicians (DA3018)*.


</div>

## All of this is well integrated to RStudio

```{r, out.width = "750px"}
knitr::include_graphics("RStudio-Logo-Blue-Gradient.png")
```

Also .Rproj for increased portability.

## Summary

* Everything written in code: R

* Portable: .Rproj (RStudio)

* Accessible: GitHub

* Automated: R Markdown

## Course structure

* Preparation: Excersises at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) before class.
* In class: Mainly short reviews/lectures followed by supervised programming excersises.
* Examination:
    - 6 homework problems.
    - Digital exam.
    - Individual project.
    
## Homework problems (3 hp, Pass/Fail)

* Six sets of problems with deadlines the coming six Sundays.
* To be solved individually. 
* Suspicions of plagiarism (e.g. copying of other student's code) will be reported.
* Peer review.
* Missed deadline/fail: Re-examination in February.
* Individual homeworks are not valid for the next course offering (autumn 2019).

## Digital exam (1,5hp, A-F, 21/12)
